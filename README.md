Masters Project: "Arbitrage Strategies in Cryptocurrency Markets"

Three different types of arbitrage, triangular, statistical and perpetual futures.

Triangular: Binance (Data currently being collected)
Statistical - Logistic Regression: Binance (data being collected)
Perpetual Futures: Binance (no data, capped Rf, not very fun :( ), Kraken (every 4 hrs and historic, more fun :) )
